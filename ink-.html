    <h1>Ink !</h1>
    <h2>Hunter</h2>
    <p>Ink was a collection of 17 works created with ink and sharpie on paper. The project was loosely based on Inktober which is a month long online event that asks artists to create works of art in ink for each day in October. I didnâ€™t follow any prompts, I just took the challenge as an opportunity to draw with ink as my medium for as many days in October as possible. My inspiration for the images was Halloween and many cult favorite horror films. I tried to incorporate spooky themes such as cyborg birds, bloodsucking femmes, and censoring on the internet.</p>

    <p>I used to only create from a dark place. For me art was my therapy, it was my outlet for negative emotions. It felt like art for me was a way of healing. When I was feeling down I didn't have to even think about it, I could just create.</p><img src="res/ink/ink1.jpg"/><img src="res/ink/ink2.jpg"/><img src="res/ink/ink3.PNG"/><img src="res/ink/ink4.jpg"/><p>Eventually I tried to change that, I didn't only want to be able to feel my most creative and most visionary when I'm sad. You don't want to be channelling only negative emotions for something you like to do. You don't want to be depressed for something you're good at. It was kind of a struggle to change it. I started looking for prompts. Putting myself into places where I had to create. Joining clubs. I get inspired when I create with other people.</p><img src="res/ink/ink5.jpg"/><img src="res/ink/ink6.jpg"/><p>There was one thing that I liked though. When you create as therapy, you get those thoughts out of your head. It allows you to look at your thoughts in a different angle. When you look at what you create, you can see: maybe those negative emotions weren't even so bad.</p><img src="res/ink/ink7.jpg"/><img src="res/ink/ink8.jpg"/><img src="res/ink/ink9.jpg"/><p>Now, what I want people to take away from my art is to be inspired to change. To be given an emotion that allows them to do something--whether that emotion is happy, sad, etc. A lot of my stuff is on creating futures, they're abstract. So it can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on where you're coming from. I just want you to feel like you're ready to take action like you're ready to change. Whatever that change means to you.</p><img src="res/ink/ink10.jpg"/><img src="res/ink/ink12.jpg"/><p>Other Works</p><img src="res/ink/john.jpg"/><img src="res/ink/breathe.jpg"/><img src="res/ink/umd.jpg"/><p>Find more at https://www.hunterjpg.com/</p>
