      He had to be at least 8, but he was knocking out 4th grade problems with ease. Every problem I gave him, he flew past. Every concept I taught him, he internalized instantly. His small hands clutched the pencil like a paintbrush; stroke by stroke he created masterpieces of numbers and shapes and symbols in a symphony of logic and reason. When he knocked out these problems, his actions had a confidence to him that replaced the nervousness that followed him into the room; a simmer of heat that can only be felt if you were paying attention.

      He reminded me of the younger me. His ears were outgrowing his diamond-esque face, giving an endearing glow. A frail skinny boy, he was a few shades darker than caramel, more like the color of the wood that you saw on school desks and shoddy number two pencils. His eyebrows caressed his other facial features, Goldilocks size strips that curved in coming from the nose and evened out. His nose was sharp, straight as an arrow. Definitely not Pakistani. His thin lips kept his mouth shut tight, two prison bars of shyness that kept from his thoughts and emotions from spilling out. I saw my eyes when I looked at his, deep blacks that could spill emotion despite their neutral nature. Yet the fervor and determination that I observed in his body language didn't match what his eyes were telling me

      He hands me the paper I gave him with the black lead of his pencil scribbled throughout the white filet. I just described to him how to calculate the surface area of a pyramid legitimately 5 minutes ago, yet the work in front of me looked like an answer key. "I am shocked." I tell him. His face turns anxious, scared even. He whispers a murmur out from the cell trying to keep his voice from escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You got all of them right."

      A grin sprinted up to his larger than life ears. His eyebrows shot up in a cheer and his eyes blanketed me with color. I couldn't help but smile too. "Ok, next worksheet then."
      "But I'm bored."

      A peculiar peep. People like him usually love math, describe it as their passion and joy. He seemed like the person who's parents forced him into math and his feeble-mind accepted and adapted. I get curious and try to dig at his personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your favorite subject then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Social Studies!" I was surprised, shocked even. The astonishment that hit my brain must have reflected in my face as well because he started smiling even louder. Kids of my color aren't into this; they're engineers and doctors, scientists and computer geeks. We're workhorses, our only free thoughts are able to breathe in the respective fields that our parents chose for us. This process brainwashes us into believing that these skills are the only ones that matter, only ones that make money. Sooner or later, we start believing that these are the only skills that change the world, unable to realize that the white man above us are really calling the shots. His organized pencil case, effortless math skills, and silent demeanor convinced me that he was already in the full swing of this process. This shimmer of independence, this slice of free thought almost made me cry.

      I start to describe to him how the Ancient Egyptians used surface area to build their massive pyramids oh so long ago. Every word he hung to, every syllable he gasped in awe. When I told him that what he did just then was the exact procedure that the Egyptians did, he almost overdosed in joy. His black pupils exclaimed in rays of happy yellows, comforting blues, exciting greens. I looked into his eyes and saw what it meant to be to be a kid. It meant to be surprised by the world at every step, every day a new experience, every twist and turn can come enjoyment and excitement. I looked into his eyes and saw imagination.

    <p>
      I looked into his eyes and saw a leader.
