    <h1>about where?!</h1>
    <p>where?! the Magazine is about exploring the feeling of not knowing where to go in life. It publishes content that explores this feeling, whether it’s art that deals with it, ideas that explain why it occurs, poetry that reflets on it, videos that challenge it, etc.</p>
    <p>Please contact wherethemagazine@gmail.com for inquiries, submission requests, and joining the team.</p>
    <p>where?! the Magazine has no relationship to WhereTraveler or any other magazine with where without the ?! characters.</p>

        <p>I draw stuff on the computer and sometimes drop some wisdom in the groupchat. People often ask me, "Zev, how can you do so much for Where!? Magazine while also being an internationally renowned artist and also software engineer, and also save all those puppies and children!?" I'm able to do all this by drawing on the power of onions. An inspiration to us all. &lt;3</p>
