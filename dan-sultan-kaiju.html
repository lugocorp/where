    <h1>Dan Sultan (Kaiju)</h1>
    <h2>JUBA Jonez</h2>
    <p>This piece explores the contradictions of man’s and society’s fickle moral fiber. When times are good, all that’s presented is good, but when times get tough, or the opportunity to seize and betray is presented, the inner monster, the inner Kaiju so to speak, rears its head. Of course, the one who avoids such spinelessness is a boss, a Dan Sultan of sorts. Photo by Myke Symon on Unsplash.</p>
